# js-modules-practice

1. export / import vs module.exports / require
   - export / import is the newer ES6 module syntax
   - module.exports / require is the older CommonJS module syntax
   - won't work using the export syntax of one and the import syntax of the other


2. Why choose ES modules for modern Node projects? 
   - ES modules are now natively supported by Node and will future proof projects 
     as it is the newer standard and will be supported for years to come
   - Has better maintability than CommonJS modules
